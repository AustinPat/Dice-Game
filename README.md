# Dice Game

Dice-Game
This game was made from Jonas Schmedtmann's Complete Javascript course on Udemy.

GAME RULES:

* The game has 2 players, playing in rounds
* In each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as he whishes. Each result get added to his score
* The score limit can be set to any positive number
* If the player rolls a 1, all his ROUND score gets lost. After that, it's the next player's turn
* If a a player rolls two 6's in a row then their total score gets reset to 0
* The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his total score. After that, it's the next player's turn
* The first player to reach 100 or set target on the total wins the game

Changes made to the original are

* Animation when a 1 or two 6's are rolled
* Showed losing die for a second before disappearing
* Disabled 'Roll Dice' whilst animation is playing
* Set score is not applied until button is pressed
